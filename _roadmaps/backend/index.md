# Backend Development Roadmap

Welcome to Senior Porter's streamlined backend development roadmap! This focused 9-week journey is designed for busy developers who want to build real backend skills without overwhelming themselves.

## üéØ Why This Roadmap Works

**Sustainable Pace**: 20 hours/week maximum - perfect for working professionals
**Practical Focus**: Build real projects, not just tutorials  
**Progressive Learning**: Each step builds on the previous one
**Battle-Tested**: Based on Senior Porter's experience training dozens of developers

---

## üìÖ Week-by-Week Breakdown

### üöÄ Step 1: Server Fundamentals (Weeks 1-3)
*"Before you can run, you need to walk. Before you can build APIs, you need to understand servers."*

{% for section in page.steps[0].sections %}
**{{ section.title }}** ({{ section.hours }} hours)
- [Start Learning ‚Üí]({{ section.link }})
{% endfor %}

**Week 1 Goal**: Understand how web requests work  
**Week 2 Goal**: Build your first Express server  
**Week 3 Goal**: Master middleware and routing patterns

---

### üóÑÔ∏è Step 2: Database Integration (Weeks 4-6) 
*"Data is the heart of every backend. Learn to handle it with care."*

{% for section in page.steps[1].sections %}
**{{ section.title }}** ({{ section.hours }} hours)
- [Start Learning ‚Üí]({{ section.link }})
{% endfor %}

**Week 4 Goal**: Set up PostgreSQL and understand databases  
**Week 5 Goal**: Write complex SQL queries confidently  
**Week 6 Goal**: Design efficient data models

---

### üîê Step 3: API Development (Weeks 7-9)
*"APIs are contracts. Design them well, secure them properly."*

{% for section in page.steps[2].sections %}
**{{ section.title }}** ({{ section.hours }} hours)
- [Start Learning ‚Üí]({{ section.link }})
{% endfor %}

**Week 7 Goal**: Build RESTful APIs following best practices  
**Week 8 Goal**: Implement secure user authentication  
**Week 9 Goal**: Deploy your API to production

## üõ†Ô∏è What You'll Build

By the end of this roadmap, you'll have built a **Task Management API** that includes:
- User registration and authentication
- CRUD operations for tasks
- Database relationships and queries
- Deployed to a cloud service

## ‚è∞ Time Management Tips

**20 Hours/Week Breakdown:**
- 3-4 focused study sessions of 5-7 hours each
- Mix theory (30%) with hands-on coding (70%)
- Take breaks every 90 minutes
- Weekend project work for reinforcement

**Senior Porter's Schedule Suggestion:**
- **Monday**: 6 hours - Deep learning new concepts
- **Wednesday**: 7 hours - Hands-on coding practice  
- **Saturday**: 7 hours - Project work and integration

## üçÑ Porter Community Support

**Weekly Check-ins**: Each section has discussion points  
**Code Reviews**: Share your projects for feedback  
**Office Hours**: Senior Porter hosts weekly Q&A sessions

## üéØ Success Metrics

**Week 3**: Can build a basic Express server  
**Week 6**: Can design and query a database  
**Week 9**: Can deploy a secure API to production
