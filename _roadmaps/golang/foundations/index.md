# Go Foundations

**What is Go?** Go is a programming language created by Google that's designed to be simple, fast, and reliable. Think of it as a language that combines the best parts of other languages: it's as easy to read as Python, as fast as C++, and handles multiple tasks at once better than most languages. It's particularly loved for building web servers, command-line tools, and applications that need to handle thousands of users simultaneously.


Welcome to the start of our community Go journey! This is where we all begin together - setting up our development environment, writing our first Go programs, and understanding what makes Go special.

## Key Characteristics

- **Simple & Clean Syntax** ‚Üí Similar to C, but easier to read and write
- **Compiled** ‚Üí Produces fast, statically linked binaries with no runtime dependency
- **Statically Typed** ‚Üí Variable types are checked at compile time, reducing runtime errors
- **Garbage Collected** ‚Üí Memory management is automatic
- **Cross-Platform** ‚Üí Can compile to different operating systems and architectures easily
- **Concurrency Built-in** ‚Üí Goroutines and channels make concurrent programming straightforward
- **Minimalistic** ‚Üí Small standard library, but powerful; avoids complexity

## What We'll Cover Together

The foundations section gets everyone in our community on the same page with:

### üõ†Ô∏è [Go Installation & Setup]({{ '/roadmaps/golang/foundations/setup/' | relative_url }})
Get Go and VS Code installed and verified. We keep this short and direct, referencing official docs.

**What you'll do**: Download, install, and verify your Go installation plus set up VS Code with the Go extension.

---

### üëã [Your First Go Program]({{ '/roadmaps/golang/foundations/first-program/' | relative_url }})
Write and run Hello World, understand Go modules, and learn the basic program structure.

**What you'll do**: Create your first Go module, write Hello World, and understand what each line does.

---

### ü§î [Why Use Go]({{ '/roadmaps/golang/foundations/why-go/' | relative_url }})
Explore Go's design philosophy and discover why companies choose Go for modern development.

**What you'll learn**: Go's core philosophy, real-world use cases, and practical benefits that make Go popular for CLIs, DevOps, cloud services, and web development.

---

### üìö [The History of Go]({{ '/roadmaps/golang/foundations/go-history/' | relative_url }})
Understand Go's origins and the problems it was designed to solve.

**What you'll discover**: Why Google created Go, the timeline from whiteboard to open source, and the key innovations that shaped the language.

---

### ‚ö° [The Go Command]({{ '/roadmaps/golang/foundations/go-command/' | relative_url }})
Master the go command - your main tool for managing Go source code.

**What you'll master**: Essential go commands for building, testing, and managing Go projects efficiently.

---

## Community Foundation Goals

By completing these foundation steps together, our community will have:

- ‚úÖ **Common environment**: Everyone running the same Go version with VS Code
- ‚úÖ **Shared understanding**: We all know how to create and run Go programs
- ‚úÖ **Ready foundation**: Prepared for language basics and beyond

## Foundation Complete? What's Next

Once you've finished both foundation sections, you're ready to continue with our community as we build out the next parts of our Go roadmap together.
