# Go Foundations

Welcome to the start of our community Go journey! This is where we all begin together - setting up our development environment, writing our first Go programs, and understanding what makes Go special.

## What We'll Cover Together

The foundations section gets everyone in our community on the same page with:

### üõ†Ô∏è [Go Installation & Setup]({{ '/roadmaps/golang/foundations/setup/' | relative_url }})
Get Go and VS Code installed and verified. We keep this short and direct, referencing official docs.

**What you'll do**: Download, install, and verify your Go installation plus set up VS Code with the Go extension.

---

### üëã [Your First Go Program]({{ '/roadmaps/golang/foundations/first-program/' | relative_url }})
Write and run Hello World, understand Go modules, and learn the basic program structure.

**What you'll do**: Create your first Go module, write Hello World, and understand what each line does.

---

## Community Foundation Goals

By completing these foundation steps together, our community will have:

- ‚úÖ **Common environment**: Everyone running the same Go version with VS Code
- ‚úÖ **Shared understanding**: We all know how to create and run Go programs
- ‚úÖ **Ready foundation**: Prepared for language basics and beyond

## Foundation Complete? What's Next

Once you've finished both foundation sections, you're ready to continue with our community as we build out the next parts of our Go roadmap together.

**Back to**: [Go Development Roadmap]({{ '/roadmaps/golang/' | relative_url }}) to see the full learning path.
