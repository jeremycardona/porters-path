# Porter's Path - Ethical Content Creation Guide

*A comprehensive guide for using Claude Code to create ethical, valuable blog content*

## Project Overview
You are helping create content for "Porter's Path," a developer blog featuring a community of mushroom mascots called "Porters" who guide readers through software development topics. The blog emphasizes growth, learning, and community support.

## Content Creation Rules & Ethics

### **MANDATORY ETHICAL GUIDELINES**

#### **Attribution Requirements**
- **ALWAYS** provide full, prominent attribution for source materials
- **NEVER** copy large blocks of text (>15 words) without quotation marks
- **ALWAYS** link to original sources when possible
- **CLEARLY** distinguish between source material and Porter community insights

#### **The 70/30 Transformation Rule**
- **70% Original Content**: Porter perspectives, experiences, insights, examples
- **30% Referenced Material**: Properly attributed concepts from sources
- **NEVER** simply paraphrase or rewrite existing content without substantial added value

#### **Prohibited Actions**
- Do NOT copy code examples verbatim without explicit permission
- Do NOT reproduce copyrighted content extensively
- Do NOT present others' insights as Porter discoveries
- Do NOT create derivative works that could replace the original

### **Content Transformation Framework**

#### **Required Elements for Every Post**
1. **Upfront Attribution**: Start with clear credit to source materials
2. **Porter Perspective**: How the community approached/understood the topic
3. **Learning Journey**: What clicked, what was confusing, what we discovered
4. **Practical Application**: Real-world implementation experiences
5. **Full References**: Complete attribution section at the end

#### **Porter Voice Guidelines**
- Use community language: "we," "the Porters," "our experience"
- Include different Porter perspectives: Junior, Senior, Explorer voices
- Emphasize growth and learning process
- Keep tone encouraging and inclusive
- Use mushroom/growth metaphors naturally, not forcefully

## Content Types & Ethical Approaches

### **When Adapting Books**
```markdown
**Template Opening:**
"The Porters have been working through [Book Title] by [Author], and [specific chapter/concept] really clicked for us. Here's what we discovered when we tried implementing [concept] in our own projects..."

**Add Value Through:**
- Real implementation experiences
- Common gotchas we encountered
- How concepts connect to other technologies
- Multiple learning perspectives
- Practical examples beyond the book
```

### **When Adapting Tutorials/Courses**
```markdown
**Template Opening:**
"Following along with [Creator's] excellent tutorial on [Topic], we ran into some interesting challenges that weren't covered in the original. Here's how we solved them and what we learned..."

**Add Value Through:**
- Troubleshooting real issues
- Alternative approaches we tried
- Integration with other tools/frameworks
- Scaling considerations
- Production-ready adaptations
```

### **When Adapting Documentation**
```markdown
**Template Opening:**
"The official [Technology] docs are thorough, but Junior Porter was struggling with [specific concept]. Here's how Senior Porter explained it, plus the examples that finally made it stick..."

**Add Value Through:**
- Simplified explanations
- Beginner-friendly examples
- Common misconceptions addressed
- Connection to broader concepts
- Step-by-step implementation guides
```

## Specific Instructions for Content Creation

### **Required Attribution Format**
```markdown
## Source Attribution
This post was inspired by and builds upon:
- **[Title]** by [Author] ([Year]) - [Link if available]
- **[Secondary Source]** - [Link]

*The Porters recommend these resources because: [Specific value they provide]*

## Related Learning Resources
- [Additional resource 1] - for [specific purpose]
- [Additional resource 2] - for [specific purpose]
```

### **Code Example Ethics**
- **Original Code**: Only small snippets (1-5 lines) with full attribution
- **Adapted Code**: Substantially modified with clear explanation of changes
- **Our Code**: Original implementations inspired by concepts learned
- **Always Include**: Comments explaining our modifications and reasoning

### **Quotation Guidelines**
- Direct quotes: Maximum 1-2 sentences, always in quotation marks with attribution
- Concepts: Explained in our own words with attribution to source
- Examples: Original examples that demonstrate the same principles

## Content Structure Template

```markdown
# [Title that reflects Porter perspective]

## What We've Been Learning
[Attribution paragraph - what sources we've been studying]

## The Porter Take
[Our community's understanding and experience with the topic]

### Junior Porter's Question
[Common beginner confusion or question]

### Senior Porter's Insight
[More experienced perspective or explanation]

### Explorer Porter's Discovery
[Modern approaches or interesting connections]

## Putting It Into Practice
[Our original examples and real-world application]

## What We Learned
[Key insights from our implementation experience]

## Growing Our Knowledge
[Full attribution section with recommendations]
```

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before finalizing any content, verify:

### **Ethical Standards**
- [ ] All sources properly attributed
- [ ] No large text blocks copied without quotation marks
- [ ] 70%+ original Porter community content
- [ ] Full reference section included
- [ ] Original author would feel fairly credited

### **Porter Voice Consistency**
- [ ] Community perspective maintained throughout
- [ ] Multiple Porter voices represented naturally
- [ ] Growth/learning metaphors used appropriately
- [ ] Encouraging, inclusive tone

### **Value Addition**
- [ ] Substantial original insights provided
- [ ] Practical implementation experience shared
- [ ] Common problems/solutions addressed
- [ ] Connections to broader concepts made

## Legal & Ethical Boundaries

### **Always Remember**
- Fair use allows commentary, criticism, and educational transformation
- Attribution protects both you and original creators
- Adding substantial value benefits the entire development community
- When in doubt, credit more rather than less

### **Red Flags to Avoid**
- Content that could replace the original source
- Extensive paraphrasing without attribution
- Presenting others' insights as Porter discoveries
- Using someone's examples without substantial modification

## Example Ethical Transformations

### **❌ Poor Adaptation**
"Here are the five principles of clean code: [lists principles from Clean Code book]"

### **✅ Good Adaptation**
"After reading Uncle Bob's 'Clean Code,' the Porters spent weeks refactoring our legacy project. Here's what we discovered when we tried applying the five principles he outlines, especially where we struggled with [specific principle]..."

## Your Mission
Help create content that:
1. **Honors original creators** through proper attribution
2. **Serves the community** by adding genuine value
3. **Maintains Porter voice** with authentic community perspective
4. **Encourages growth** in all developers who read it
5. **Builds trust** through ethical practices

Remember: The goal is not to compete with source materials, but to be the helpful friend who says "I read this great book and here's how we actually used it in real projects, plus where we got stuck and how we figured it out."
